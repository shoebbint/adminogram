# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
## `used libraries`
Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI: Utilize Tailwind CSS framework along with DaisyUI for rapid UI development and styling.

React Router: Implement client-side routing to enable navigation between different pages or views in the application.

Axios: Use Axios to make HTTP requests to external APIs or your backend server.

Firebase Authentication: Authenticate users using Firebase Authentication service to enable secure access to your application.

React Firebase Hooks: Utilize React Firebase Hooks to simplify interactions with Firebase services, such as Firestore, Realtime Database, and Authentication.

Font Awesome Icons: Access a wide range of icons from Font Awesome and use them in your application.
In the project directory, you can run:

###  `Folder Structure`
The project follows a common folder structure for a React application:

src: Contains the source code files.

components: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.

pages: Contains individual page components that are rendered by React Router.

services: Contains service modules responsible for interacting with external APIs or backend services.

utils: Contains utility functions or helper modules.

firebaseConfig.js: Firebase configuration file.

App.js: Main application component.

index.js: Entry point of the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
